            <p>Minecraft is an open-world game in which the building and creative possibilities are endless. First introduced in November of 2011 by game developer Mojang Studios, Minecraft has since taken the world by storm--showing up in various forms of media and being a very prominent game of the 2010s. Other than multiplayer servers, gamers have the option to play in Survival or Creative Mode. In Survival Mode, players must gather the resources needed to stay alive and advance through the world, or, in Creative Mode, players are provided with every resource in the game and can create anything they desire. Over time, Minecraft has allowed gamers to express themselves, explore, and connect with others who share a love of such a versatile game.</p>

        <h3>Getting Started in Survival Mode</h2>

            <p>Once a player has initially entered a world in Survival mode, it is recommended he or she gather wood by punching a tree to then convert it into sticks and wood planks needed to make tools and crafting tables. From these wooden materials, the player can then create wooden tools such as an axe, pickaxe, sword, shovel, and more. Using these starter tools, players can begin to gather common materials essential to survival and advancement in the game. For example, a wooden pickaxe can be used to mine coal for torches and cobblestone for furnaces and building materials; wool can be collected from sheep to create a bed which prevents monsters from spawning. Once players have collected some common materials, they can begin to build shelters to protect themselves from monsters and have a main place to store the items they collect. After creating shelter, whether temporary or permanent, players should have the starting essentials to continue exploring and gathering in their Minecraft world.</p>
