            <h2>Survival Mode</h2>
            <p>Minecraft offers several distinct game modes, each providing a unique way to experience the game and its many features. In Survival Mode, players start with minimal resources and must gather materials, craft items, and build shelters to survive against the elements and hostile mobs. This mode emphasizes resource management and strategic planning, making it ideal for those who enjoy a challenge and a sense of progression. Survival Mode also includes health and hunger bars that must be managed to maintain gameplay balance.</p>
