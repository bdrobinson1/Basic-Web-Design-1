            <h2>Battle Royale Mode</h2>
            <p>At the heart of Fortnite is its iconic Battle Royale mode, where up to 100 players drop onto a vibrant island and compete to be the last one standing. Players can choose to go solo, team up in duos, or squad up with friends. The excitement lies in the combination of combat, strategy, and building skills.</p>

            <h3>Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gather Resources: Players collect materials from the environment—like wood, brick, and metal—by harvesting trees, rocks, and buildings. These resources are essential for constructing defensive structures and gaining a strategic advantage.</li>
                <li>Weapons & Items: The game features a wide array of weapons, from pistols and shotguns to sniper rifles and explosives. Players can find items throughout the map, including shields, health packs, and special power-ups.</li>
                <li>Safe Zone: As the match progresses, a storm encroaches, shrinking the playable area. This forces players into tighter spaces, encouraging encounters and strategic gameplay. Staying inside the safe zone is crucial to survival.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Tips & Strategies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Master Building: Building is a core mechanic in Fortnite. Practice constructing ramps and walls quickly to gain height during battles, which can be a game-changer in firefights.</li>
                <li>Choose Landing Spots Wisely: Familiarize yourself with the map to select ideal landing locations. Look for areas with good loot but lower player traffic to increase your chances of survival early on.</li>
                <li>Stay Aware of the Storm: Always keep an eye on the storm circle. Plan your movements to avoid getting caught outside the safe zone, as the storm can deal significant damage over time.</li>
                <li>Sound Awareness: Use headphones to listen for audio cues. Footsteps, chests, and other sounds can provide critical information about enemy locations and loot opportunities.</li>
                <li>Adapt Your Playstyle: Each match is different. Be ready to adjust your strategy based on your weapons, resources, and the number of remaining players.</li>
            </ul>
