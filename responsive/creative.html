                    <h3>Features</h3>
                    <p>In Creative Mode, players enjoy an infinite supply of all available blocks and items, making it easy to build anything from majestic castles to sprawling cities. The ability to fly is another key feature, providing a bird's-eye view and ease of access to high or hard-to-reach areas. This freedom means that players are not burdened by health or hunger, allowing them to focus entirely on their creative projects.</p>
                    <p>Players benefit from instant block placement and destruction, which accelerates the building process and simplifies experimentation with different designs. The inventory is fully stocked with every block and item in the game, giving players unrestricted access to all resources and tools.</p>
