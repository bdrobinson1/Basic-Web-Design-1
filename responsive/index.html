            <h2>Game Modes</h2>
            <p>In Minecraft, players start with a single goal: to survive and thrive in a world made entirely of blocks. The game features several modes including Survival, Creative, Adventure, and Spectator. Each mode offers a unique way to experience the game, catering to different play styles. In Survival mode, players must gather resources and manage hunger while defending against hostile creatures. Creative mode, on the other hand, allows for unlimited resources and freedom to build and experiment without any constraints. Adventure mode is designed for custom maps and challenges, while Spectator mode lets players explore worlds without interacting with them.</p>
